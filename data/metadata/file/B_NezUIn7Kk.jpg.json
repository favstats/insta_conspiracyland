    "description": "Eddie Murphy telling the story of how Sammy Davis Jr told him he worshipped the devil. No wonder Sammy Davis was so popular in Hollyweird back in the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s. Believe it or not, there\u2019s a lot of people who believe in that ridiculous rhetoric that \u201csatan is as powerful as the Heavenly Father\u201d! Do people not know that satan has to ask the Father before he\u2019s allowed to do anything??!! The Heavenly Father is in control of the good and the bad! People better wake up! #hollyweirdisevil #ImReaching #HollyweirdIsEvilFellOff",
