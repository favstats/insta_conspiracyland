They tell me they found no violations, yet they still go ahead & delete my account? Keep it up Jack. You\u2019re only pissing more people off & furthering the legal ground  for the class action lawsuit I\u2019m about to start. The game of silencing America-loving Patriots with the intentions of influencing the election & destroying this nation\u2019s freedom is OVER!!!! \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcaf #WWG1WGA #DarkToLight #TheGreatAwakening #GodWins #PatriotsAreInControl #TrustThePlan #PanicInDC #Qanon #TheStormIsUponUs #NothingCanStopWhatsComing\n\n#TheBaQery\n@wwg1wga_ \n@qmaildrops \n@rabbit_seventeen\n@ashlynn139 \n@_factsoverfeelings\n@ask_the_q\n@teejtheworst\n@educatingliberals \n@redshiftreality \n@qanon_obiwan \n@docs_red_hat \n@brandonthetruthvera\n@patkeller1\n@patriotpoliticsresearch \n@francohammer\n@sergeant_stickittooya\n@cjtruth17",
