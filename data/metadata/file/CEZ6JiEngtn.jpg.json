    "description": "It's easy to fall into the traps the matrix sets for us. These traps can make you forget who you are, what you believe and what your core values are. They want you to compromise what you believe in to gain as much control over you as possible. You all know who you are. You know your purpose on this Earth. You know what makes you happy. You know the things you won\u2019t sacrifice under any circumstances. Don't question yourself. Most importantly, don't allow this society dictate how you should see yourself and what you think you should do. Choose to act and speak with conviction, and never compromise your beliefs. Do not doubt yourself, do not lose your values, do not change for someone else. It is during these times when you should become even more sure of yourself.",
