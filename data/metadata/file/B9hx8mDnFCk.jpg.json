This is also a little bit before her breakdown also when she shaved her head. She said she was sick of people touching her but she was really sick of hollyweird. If you could interview most celebrities, they would tell you how miserable they are. I\u2019ve already put together a compilation of videos of celebrities telling you how unhappy they are on my page. Just scroll down. And they also said how if they could do it all over again, they would not sign that deal. Stop thirsting for fame and fortune! It will NEVER bring you happiness! #hollyweirdisevil",
