    "description": "Bipartisan leaders of two powerful congressional committees told the Federal Communications Commission to reverse a ruling allowing a Virginia company to activate a 5G network that could disrupt military and other GPS signals.\n\nThe leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services committees wrote in an\u00a0appeal\u00a0Wednesday that they would force the issue through legislation if the FCC does not overturn its own decision to allow\u00a0Ligado Networks\u00a0to implement a network on the L-band spectrum.\n\nLigado\u2019s plan to use the L-band would risk interfering with signals that are important to national security, wrote Sens. Jim Inhofe and Jack Reed, along with Reps. Adam Smith and\u00a0Mac Thornberry, who are the chairmen and ranking members of the two committees.\n\nThe four leaders noted that the country\u2019s current most pressing concern is the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cBut the Federal Communications Commission has used the crisis, under the cover of darkness, to\u00a0approve a long-stalled application\u00a0by Ligado Networks \u2013\u00a0a proposal that threatens to undermine our global positioning system (GPS) capabilities, and with it, our national security,\u201d the leaders wrote.\n\nThe proposal from Ligado is opposed by multiple U.S. agencies, the leaders also reminded the FCC. \u201cThe departments of Defense, Commerce, Interior, Justice, Homeland Security, Energy, and Transportation \u2013\u00a0as well as NASA, the National Science Foundation, the Coast Guard and the Federal Aviation Administration \u2013\u00a0all strongly object to Ligado\u2019s plan.\u201d The committee leaders asked those FCC to cancel the Ligado ruling. \u201cIf they do not, and unless President Trump intervenes to stop this from moving forward,\u201d they wrote, \u201cit will be up to Congress to clean up this mess.\u201d @jtnreports",
