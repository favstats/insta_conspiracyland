I didn\u2019t know what the program stood for so here\u2019s what it is. \nThe Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) provides federal grants to states for supplemental foods, health care referrals, and nutrition education for low-income pregnant, breastfeeding, and non-breastfeeding postpartum women, and to infants and children up to age five who are found to be at nutritional risk. It\u2019s only for those items so if you don\u2019t need that all else being equal buy something else. #togetherapart \n#Repost @tanksgoodnews\n\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\nThis is SUPER important\nReposted from @donaldjtrumpjr",
