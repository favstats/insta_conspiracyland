    "description": "Thoughts?\n\nOfficials in #China have become inundated with people who have fallen ill with the #Coronavirus and the outbreak may be far worse than what is being reported by the media.\n\nPeople continue to fall dead in the streets of #Hong#Kong after contracting the deadly fast-spreading and mutating virus.\n\nThe virus can be identified with the word \u201ccrown\u201d which means \u201cthe top or highest part of something,\u201d according to the definition \u2014 which begs the question: Was the #Coronavirus engineered?\n\nThe answer is yes, the virus was engineered. It\u2019s manmade.\n\nThe Coronavirus was patented (U.S. Patent # 10130701) in 2015 by the #PirbrightInstitute. (i.e. the virus is likely a bioweapon)\n\nA description of the patent reads: \u201cThe present invention provides a live, attenuated coronavirus comprising a variant replicase gene encoding polyproteins comprising a mutation in one or more of non-structural protein(s) (nsp)-10, nsp-14, nsp-15 or nsp-16. The coronavirus may be used as a vaccine for treating and/or preventing a disease, such as infectious bronchitis, in a subject.\u201d There has been an immense effort by Chinese state media to coverup the magnitude of the outbreak and the #WorldHealthOrganization is dragging its feet as usual.\n\nThe #Trumpadministration has failed to halt all incoming travel from countries of infectious origins and martial law is already underway in China just one week in.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I hate to be the first to break the bad news to you but the #UnitedStates will soon follow lockstep so now is the time to prepare.\n\nAt best we are looking at a number of people in the U.S. falling ill to the deadly virus that has already killed a reported 17 people and likely a lot more.\n\nAt worst we are looking at full-scale pandemic Level 5 #martiallaw which will result in quarantines and food shortages which could then ultimately lead to riots and all of this could happen faster than you might think. \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe#BioWarfare",
