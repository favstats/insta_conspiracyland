To hold an ideal in your mind about how the world is and have it crash down. To be lied to. It\u2019s hard. .\n.\n\nBut just because it\u2019s hard doesn\u2019t mean that we shouldn\u2019t know it. All American\u2019s deserve to know the truth. We have all been duped no matter what side of the political spectrum you are on. .\n.\nMany of us have prayed for this information to come out for years now and more is exposed each day. .\n.\n\nLet\u2019s do our best to be nice to each other and stand together as Americans and not be angry at each other, but rather be angry at the people who have abused their power and lied to our country. We have all been lied to for way to long. .\n.\nIt\u2019s time we take our country back. \u270a\ud83c\udffb\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb #obamagate\n#thegreatawakening \n#wwgw1wga",
