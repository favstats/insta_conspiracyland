    "description": "#Missouri #peachfarmer Bill Bader says half of his 30,000 trees now produce #peaches the \u201csize of a quarter.\u201d A Missouri peach farmer just set an awesome precedent in a court battle against #Monsanto\u2019s new #dicamba herbicide.\n\nMonsanto\u2019s new dicamba weedkiller was first approved for use in 2017. Since then, it has wreaked havoc on millions of acres of non-GMO crops across #America.\n\nThe company formulated the herbicide because its infamous #Roundup (#glyphosate)  stopped working\u2026 that is, glyphosate-resistant \u201csuper weeds\u201d began to grow.\n\nThus, a \u201cnew and improved\u201d version of an even more toxic herbicide \u2013 dicamba \u2013 was brought to market under the brand name #Xtendimax.\n\nThe good news? Xtendimax kills super weeds (for now). The bad news? It kills everything else in its path too, except Monsanto\u2019s soy and cotton plants that have been genetically engineered to resist the herbicide.\n\nThe main reason it\u2019s so dangerous is because dicamba is far more volatile than glyphosate (Roundup), meaning it easily converts into a gas and \u201cdrifts\u201d for miles onto neighboring crops and kills them.\n\nAmong those crops were 30,000 peach trees in Missouri.\n\nThe owner of the trees, Bill Bader and his family-owned Bader Farms just won $265 million in court as the loss of his orchards essentially put him out of business.\n\nThe jury found that the former Monsanto (now Bayer) and chemical giant BASF conspired in creating an \u201cecological disaster\u201d designed to increase profits at the expense of farmers. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad,\u201d attorney Bill Randles told the Sierra Club. \u201cHe\u2019s been the \u2018peach guy.\u2019 Now . . . his peach farm cannot survive.\u201d The Bader lawsuit is one of many class-action lawsuits blaming dicamba for damage to their orchards, gardens, and organic farm fields, representing complaints by over 2700 farmers.\n\nMonsanto first announced that it would work with BASF on a new dicamba-ready system in 2011,  because its \u201cRoundup Ready system\u201d had led to an epidemic of glyphosate-resistant weeds. \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe#FuckMonsanto",
