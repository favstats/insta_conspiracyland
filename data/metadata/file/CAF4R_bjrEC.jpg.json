    "description": "We now live in a nation where doctors destroy health, lawyers destroy justice, universities destroy knowledge, governments destroy freedom, press destroys information, banks destroy our economy - Chris Hedges (American journalist, activist, humanist, 1956). Although not much has changed I\u2019m aware that there a few people that don\u2019t fit in this statement and are true heroes in my opinion. But sadly in most cases this is still true more than ever for most of us. Be the change you want to see in the world! \ud83c\udf0d\u2764\ufe0f",
