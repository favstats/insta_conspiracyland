Western companies have announced factory and retail store closings across the country, and this will likely result in a massive loss of business that could produce an economic shock felt around the world. \nLate last week, a #Wuhan nurse made an emotional video on social media, claiming more than 90,000 have already been infected.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Epoch Times tweeted an interview with a Wuhan citizen, who says people in the outbreak areas \"\"\"\"can't get any medical treatments\"\"\"\" nor \"\"\"\"a diagnosis\"\"\"\" because hospitals are overloaded with patients. He said people \"\"\"\"sit and wait to die.\"\"\"\" \"\"\"\"Imagine being a Wuhan citizen\u2026they can't get any medical treatments, they can't even get a diagnosis. They can only sit and wait to die.\"\"\"\" \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe",
