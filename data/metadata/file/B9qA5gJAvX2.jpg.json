    "description": "To me, it\u2019s the only thing that makes sense. But I also wanted to say that it\u2019s always better to be prepared than not in case of an emergency or an inconvenient situation. Have at least 3 weeks worth of food & water along with other necessities & supplies to make your life more comfortable. Q has mentioned 10 days of darkness & this may be a period where the internet goes down & Trump communicates to us through the emergency texting alerts. This is a necessary part of the plan. Have faith in God. Prepare yourself & remember Patriots are in control. Where we go one we go all! #GreatAwakening #DarkToLight",
