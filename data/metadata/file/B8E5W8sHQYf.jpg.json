    "description": "She\u2019s speaking facts! I knew there was a reason I hated social studies growing up in school because it was all lies! It\u2019s all apart of the Rockefeller school system design to lie about the true history of the Amerikkka and maintain white superiority! It\u2019s not your fault, it\u2019s the lies they fed us and continue to feed our children. They don\u2019t even teach about slavery anymore because they want the new generation to feel like Amerikkka doesn\u2019t have a dark past and all the whites were superheroes in history! I\u2019m not trying to cause division, because at the end of the day I still love everyone! I\u2019m making you think!  #hollyweirdisevil",
