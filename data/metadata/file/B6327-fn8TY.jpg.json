    "description": "Ok family, 3 theories I have for why this happened. First reason I believe is because back in November Iran discovered a new oil field that could be worth 63 billion dollars and the Amerikkka wanted a share. That\u2019s what the last slide is talking about. Second thing is I believe they\u2019re going to orchestrate the Trump assassination. In the video, you hear people saying they\u2019re going to retaliate and kill our leaders because we killed one of theirs. The elite hate trump so I believe this could be an excuse to take him out. 3rd reason I believe this happened is because I think Iran is still not apart of the central banking system. We are only having issues with the countries who are opposing the one world currency system. This is going to start major controversy in the world. Is Amerikkka is attacked, it will be more than Iran that attacks us. We are the most hated country in the world. I love you guys and thank you for your support! #hollyweirdisevil #iran #qasemsoleymani #trump",
