    "description": "A great turnout at the Hollywood & Vine \u201cSave the Children\u201d protest today on August 22, 2020. We met people from all walks of life, Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, people who drove all the way from Las Vegas, from Riverside, parents, young adults, teenagers, who all are coming together to unify for the biggest cause of them all. To end Child Sex Trafficking. It was entirely peaceful, non-violent, and supportive, everything that the Q movement stands for and promotes.",
