    "description": "They tried to get comedian DC Curry to wear a dress 3 times in Hollyweird and he turned it down. He also says that had something to do with his career also and why it ended early. He also says that he knows people that are in Hollyweird that will do anything to raise their stature. I told you guys only a few are chosen for the 20-30 million dollar club even though most people in Hollyweird want to make that kind of money. Glad to hear he turned it down! #hollyweirdisevil",
