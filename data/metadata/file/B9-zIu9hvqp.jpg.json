Across countries hit hard by the novel #coronavirus \u2014 including #Japan, #Italy, and #Thailand \u2014 wildlife has spilled into the eerily quiet city streets, creating almost Jumanji-like scenes of creatures roaming carelessly through concrete jungles.\n#NaraPark in #Japan has long been a famous tourist destination due to its large population of gorgeous Sika deer, who are normally fed rice crackers by tourists eager to snap selfies with the beautiful deer, many of which have been trained to bow on command.\nBut since Japan's government clamped down on foreign travel to the country while quarantining travelers from South Korea and China, over 1,000 deer inside the park have struggled to feed themselves. As a result, the deer have wandered beyond the boundaries of the park and into the city of Nara in hopes to feed themselves.\nPhoto and video of the deer roaming the streets, subway stations, and landscaped front yards of the city \u2014 sometimes in herds \u2014 have been posted across social media.\nJapanese news outlet All-Nippon News Network or ANN even did a feature on the Nara Park deer invasion.\nMeanwhile in #CentralThailand, the large monkey population is also starving due to the lack of tourists, who once eagerly lined up to feed the little primates. The situation has grown so desperate that the little monkeys are engaging in fierce gang warfare in now-abandoned city plazas.\nIn Italy, swans and schools of fish have begun appearing in the canals of Venice, taking the place of the city's famous yet now-absent gondola boats.
