(Link in bio) \nThis man claims to have found the secret to cutting his fuel bills by 56% and is encouraging other drivers to follow his tips\n\nThe video blogger named Grant begins the clip telling viewers he can prove his truck has a reputation as a \"\"gas guzzler.\"\" According to Grant he discovered his vehicle was operating at an \"\"unacceptable\"\" 13.6 miles per gallon on the highway.\n\nHe then claims to have found a solution that sees a 56% better gas mileage which, he said, gives him savings of 56% in costs.\n\nThe solution comes through turning the vehicle into a \"\"water-hybrid\"\", using distilled water and a teaspoon of baking soda.\n\nBy \"\"tickling\"\" the water with 12 volts of electricity, Grant claims he can separate the hydrogen from the oxygen sending gas into the combustion chamber where he formerly got a \"\"30% burn.\"\" In most petrol vehicles, that means 70% of fuel comes out of the exhaust pipe.\n\nBut Grant claims using his system results in a \"\"100% burn\"\", bringing emissions down to \"\"almost zero\"\" and boosting horse power and saving fuel.
