    "description": "You control our world. You\u2019ve poisoned the air we breathe, contaminated the water we drink, and copyrighted the poisonous food we eat. We fight in your wars, the innocent die for your causes, and sacrifice our freedoms to protect you. You\u2019ve liquidated our savings, destroyed our middle class, and used our taxes to bailout your unending greed. We are slaves to your corporations, blinded by your media companies, your government, dependent on your banks, we are zombies to your airwaves, servants to your decadence. You\u2019ve stolen our so called democratic elections, assassinated our few great leaders, and abolished our basic rights as human beings. You own our property, shipped away our jobs, and shredded our unions. You\u2019ve profited off of disaster & creating fear, destabilized our currencies, and raised our cost of living. You\u2019ve corrupted true natural healthcare with your pharmaceutical maffia corporations that do more wrong than good & killed countless children with your vaccines. Taken away freedom of speech, our right to create or live as a free world, monopolized our freedom, stripped away our education, prentend you care for us when owning more than 80% of the worlds wealth that could feed any living creature on this earth and you have almost extinguished our flame. We are hit but we are not blind. We are bleeding\u2026 but we ain\u2019t got time to bleed out. We will bring the devilish giants to their knees and you will witness our revolution! \ud83d\udc41",
