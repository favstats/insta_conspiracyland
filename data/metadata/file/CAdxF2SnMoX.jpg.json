    "description": "Pay attention family because this going to go fairly quickly. I should\u2019ve been touched on this subject because this was the first thing these woke me up to Hollyweird. Rain man is a demon that the artist and entertainers use to perform their dirty work for them. For example, write their lyrics, perform roles, and perform on stage. I\u2019ve even had a rapper contact me from the industry and confirm this. In the first clip, listen closely to Eminem when he says, \u201cif I come back\u201d! You have to ask yourself, where is he going? Or what happened to him? He said his new name is going to Rain Man. In the third clip, listen to Jay Z say he used to write his lyrics before he started going into the \u201cRain man thing\u201d! Next clip, watch carefully as the demon \u201cRain Man\u201d appears in Rihanna\u2019s \u201cUmbrella\u201d video. For her to make that position inside of a triangle is anatomically impossible. That song was not about her loving a man, it was about her selling her soul and allowing satan in. That\u2019s why in the song she says, \u201ccome into me\u201d! And in the beginning Jay Z says \u201cgood girl gone bad\u201d! SUPERB FACTS \ud83d\udcaf #hollyweirdisevil",
