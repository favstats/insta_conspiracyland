    "description": "Have you been involved in the medical freedom movement? What is freedom? The power to act, speak, or think as one wants without hindrance or restraint. If medical freedom is of value to you, we invite you to step into the arena! See the link in our bio to the article \u201cHealth and Medical Freedom Groups\u201d in order to find your local cadre. \n\nAs a note of clarification, we archived a post we published on Sunday about how to \u201cProtect Yourself From a Virus\"\" because we realized it did not represent the way we want to teach about nutrition and health. We simply want to put forth our recommendations based on the research we\u2019ve discovered and empower you to decide for yourself what works for you and yours. That\u2019s medical freedom, folks!",
