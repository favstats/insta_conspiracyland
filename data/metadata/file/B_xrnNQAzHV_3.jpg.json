    "description": "A couple of new Q drops from less than an hour ago. Make sure you guys are being careful of what you hear & who you follow. There is an active disinformation campaign being employed in an attempt to discredit Q. But if Q was a bunch of BS & a LARP in somebody\u2019s basement like the Fake News Media says, then why in the HELL won\u2019t any of them ask the President who it is? That observation alone should be enough for anybody who is questioning Q to take a closer look into it for themselves. Seriously. Head over to Qmap.pub & make your discernments. Critical thinking is extremely important & hardly practiced anymore.\n\n#TheBaQery\n@wwg1wga_ \n@qmaildrops \n@rabbit_seventeen\n@ashlynn139 \n@_factsoverfeelings\n@ask_the_q\n@teejtheworst\n@educatingliberals \n@redshiftreality \n@qanon_obiwan \n@docs_red_hat \n@brandonthetruthvera\n@patkeller1\n@patriotpoliticsresearch \n@francohammer\n@sergeant_stickittooya\n@cjtruth17",
