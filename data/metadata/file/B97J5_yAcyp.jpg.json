    "description": "After a few comments I feel this needs to be posted once again. If we just blindly rely on what other people have posted then we have not learned anything. Stop reading just the headline. I would never post something and tell you not to do further research. That's not what this entire Q movement is all about. Do I trust the information coming from Q? Yes. Do I verify the information after they post? Absolutely. Don't be a sheep. If you have time to comment and browse social media then you have time to look up something that is actually important.\n#TheBaQery",
