    "description": "Thoughts?\n\nThe organizers of a virus-tracking project funded by Bill Gates, say their efforts are being paused while they deal with concerns raised by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe FDA has ordered SCAN, the #SeattleCoronavirusAssessmentNetwork, to stop screening for the virus, putting the program, that has been providing hundreds of home testing kits each day, on pause.\n\nThe SCAN suspension comes just a day after Bill Gates praised the effort in his personal blog. He wrote \u201cIt has the potential to become an important tool for health officials seeking insights about the spread and behavior of the virus\u201d\n\nRT reports: As of Wednesday, however, all links to the project\u2019s website redirect to a notice stating its operations are \u201ccurrently paused\u201d due to a conflict with the FDA. \u201cSCAN has been operating under an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the #WashingtonState Department of Health,\u201d the notice says, adding that while the FDA has allowed states to approve new Covid-19 tests, \u201cwe have been notified that under revised guidance issued on May 8th, a separate federal EUA is now required\u201d to continue testing.\n\nThe FDA has requested additional information about SCAN\u2019s at-home nasal swabs, and seeks clarification on the project\u2019s testing of \u201cpeople who have not reported #Covid-like illness.\u201d While the notice offered no timetable for when testing might go back online, it noted that SCAN is \u201cactively working\u201d to address the FDA\u2019s concerns and has been in contact with the agency since March.\n\nSpearheaded by five Seattle-area healthcare organizations, the program, according to Gates, was meant to create a coronavirus surveillance system by testing \u201ca sample of people in the Seattle region\u201d \u2013 both sick and healthy \u2013 in hopes of gaining insight into how the illness is \u201cmoving through the community, who is at greatest risk, and whether physical distancing measures are working.\u201d The key advantage of this at-home testing approach is that people don\u2019t need to go to a clinic, where they risk exposing themselves or others to infection. \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe",
