This is the convo I had with the person who created the video that I shared & then Q shared from my timeline. And this is also what WWG1WGA (Where We Go One We Go All) is all about - teamwork & unity towards a shared mission. Patriots do not care who gets the credit. Nor do we care about fame or money. We only care about the message being delivered to the rest of humanity so we can all live in a safer & more prosperous world under God. I hope everyone has a beautiful Friday! \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc38\ud83c\udf7f #WWG1WGA #TheBaQery #DarkToLight #atheGreatAwakening #GodWins #PatriotsAreInControl #TrustThePlan #PanicInDC #Qanon #TheStormIsUponUs #NothingCanStopWhatsComing",
