    "description": "Multiple foreign news broadcasts have announced the \u201c#NewWorldOrder\u201d has \u201ccome into force\u201d as #civilliberties are suspended and national militaries are mobilized on the streets as the #coronavirus lockdown continues around the world.\n\nTake a look at these two disturbing news broadcasts from #Australia. Pardon the language in the second clip as the viewer receiving the news about the New World Order is obviously upset. \u201cThe New World Order \u2014 our army comes marching in, partnering with our police, to help enforce the country\u2019s tough new quarantine laws,\u201d says a newsreader on the national Channel 7 news network.\n\nSky News Australia, another national network, also declared the \u201cNew World Order\u201d has \u201ccome into force.\u201d \u201cAlso, the New World Order, that will come into force at 12pm, at midnight tonight. New restrictions on various businesses. Stay with us.\u201c #DavidRockefeller famously said that a \u201cglobal crisis\u201d would have to occur before the people of the world would be willing to accept a New World Order. Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, world leaders have again proclaimed the need for a one \u201cworld government\u201d with global financial control.\n\nFormer British Prime Minister Gordon Brown urged the world to form a \u201c#globalgovernment\u201d to combat the virus and #HenryKissinger said #American citizens must accept a new \u201cliberal world order.\u201d Disturbingly, world religious leaders including #PopeFrancis are also starting to come together as one to preach from the same hymn sheet, instructing their sheep to accept the components of the New World Order\u2019s #oneworldgovernment.\n\nIn reality, the call for global government by world leaders, Pope Francis and other wealthy elitists has nothing to do with lifting up impoverished nations or \u201csaving humanity\u201d from crisis. Such a government would instead guarantee global surveillance, global wealth inequality and a world run by the exact corrupt interests currently consolidating wealth and power worldwide. #Agenda21 #Agenda2030 #Technocracy #ScientificDictatorship",
