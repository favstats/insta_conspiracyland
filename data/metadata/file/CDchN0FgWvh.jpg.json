One song on the album, \u201cMad Woman,\u201d has lyrics that imply people want her dead.  Many are speculating that she is referring to Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta, who have had a contested relationship with Swift after they purchased the rights to her first seven albums.\n.\nSwift called out Borchetta and Braun during a Billboard speech and she even placed blame on the Soros family for funding them.  It is speculated that Soros funds many of these special interests groups as well as many politically corrupt organizations, so this move should come as no surprise!  However, with Swifts lyrics insinuating that Borchetta and Brain wanted her dead, what other operations are being funded behind the scenes?\n.\n.\n.\n#PardonMyAmerican \n#EpsteinIsland \n#EpsteinDidntKillHimself\n#TaylorSwift\n#TaylorSwiftTheories \n#IsaacKappy\n#SecretSocieties \n#HollyweirdIsEvil \n#GeorgeSorosIsEvil\n#GeorgeSoros \n#DoYourOwnResearch\n#DeepStateExposed\n#ThesePeopleAreSick\n#InvestigatePizzagate\n#ClintonBodycount\n#Redpilled\n#Adrenochrome\n#TaylorSwiftFolklore\n#KillaryClinton\n#Scamdemic\n#UnsealEpstein\n#FollowTheWhiteRabbit\n#IlluminatiConfirmed\n#FallCabal\n#Illuminati\n#TaylorSwiftFans\n#QANON\n#OperationMockingbird\n#UnplugTheMatrix",
