That\u2019s an average of $870 for each one of America\u2019s 115 million families. Cato notes that this includes \u201ccash payments to farmers and research funds to high-tech companies, as well as indirect subsidies, such as funding for overseas promotion of specific U.S. products and industries\u2026It does not include tax preferences or trade restrictions.\u201d\n-\nIt does include payments to 374 individuals on the plush Upper East Side of New York City, and others who own farms, including Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi, and Ted Turner. Wealthy heir Mark Rockefeller received $342,000 to NOT farm, to allow his Idaho land to return to its natural state.\n-\nIt also includes fossil fuel subsidies, which could be anywhere from $10 billion to $41 billion per year for research and development. Yet this may be substantially underestimated. The IMF reports U.S. fossil fuel subsidies of $502 billion, which would be almost $4,400 per U.S. family by taking into account \u201cthe effects of energy consumption on global warming [and] on public health through the adverse effects on local pollution.\u201d \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f -\n-\n-\nComment your thoughts below \ud83d\udcad\u2b07\ufe0f\n-\n-\nFollow my backup! @woke_breed \n#goverment #nwo #population #control #newworldorder #elite #explorepage #pinealgland #nature #truthseeker #awake #anonymous  #conscious #collective #secretsocieties #openyoureyes #mindcontrol #awake #freedomthinker #illuminati #wokebreed #truthseeker  #seekthetruth #peoplepower #depopulation #conspiracy #woke #staywoke Follow: \ud83d\udca5 @wokebreed \ud83d\udca5",
