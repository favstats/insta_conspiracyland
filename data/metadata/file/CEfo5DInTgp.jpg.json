    "description": "Dave Martin is a comedian in Charlotte NC. He started incorporating truth into his comedy and apparently ended up losing a few thousand followers. But I do need to correct you Dave...South Dakota is the MOST evolved state in the US right now unfortunately. So South Dakota Bob is probably the one whose going to subscribe to you and is laughing his ass off, but he's the most evolved. It's Los Angeles Bob that's the one living in his mother's basement and his only friend, his brother New York Bob cheering him on, holding hid Pringles and wearing his tighty \"\"not so white\"\" whities.\n.\nSouth Dakota has not adhered to any of this garbage with facemarks and social distancing. They have had large conferences and have no issue because they are not embellishing numbers and making things up. The governor of South Dakota, Kristie Noem, is the only governor who turned down federal aid and said they didn't need it for the plandemic. She is one hell of a smart woman...and beautiful as well. If it wasn't cold 9 months out of the year up in SD, I would move to South Dakota, right next to South Dakota Bob.\n.\nThat's ok Dave...don't worry. I think you're about to get a lot more followers who actually WANT the truth....freakin' lunatics just like me!!! And if you found Dave funny, subscribe to his channel @ComedianDaveMartin. Especially if you're from South Dakota!\n.\n#covid19 #covidconspiracy #corona #patriots #patriot #patriotic #patrioticnation #DrButtar #AHEADMAP #AdvancedMedicine #AdvancedMedicineConference #IADFW #Fitness #Longevity #livelonger #livehealthy #power #facts #knowledge #truth #empowerment #livefree #livefreeordie #populationcontrol #whistleblower #soldiers #wechangetheworld #healthfreedom #health #freedom",
