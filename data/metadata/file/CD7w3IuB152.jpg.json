    "description": "This documentary should be up for every award in creation for the amount of information and sources shared in this 1hr 22 min documentary, but the truth is that the #millieweaver was arrested the day before her documentary was even released to the public. And they will not give any information on her arrest because of a sealed indictment. What information is available and a bunch of bullshit is that she was arrested for tampering with evidence, obstruction of justice and domestic violence. Which in another words is she just exposed the entire #ObamaGate, #PizzaGate, #childtrafficking, #ID2020 and every thing else the government, military & corporations burg public and private are up to behind closed doors. \n\nThis is part 1 (42 min) of the full documentary that can be found on my telegram channel (Link in bio). I will be posting the arrest of her tomorrow.",
