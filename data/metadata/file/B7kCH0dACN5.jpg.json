    "description": "This might be one of the nicest comments I\u2019ve ever received. And I felt the need to share it because I get WAY too many messages on Twitter, Facebook & Instagram to ever be able to read / respond to them all - so please don\u2019t think I\u2019m ignoring you. Also, the love mail I get far exceeds the hate mail. I get messages similar to this one every single day & I just wanted to thank you guys for your support. None of us are more important than the next. And we are all in this together. God bless you guys & keep fighting to spread the truth. #DarkToLight #WWG1WGA \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",
