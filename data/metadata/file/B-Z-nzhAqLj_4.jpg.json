This man was once a coke addict & is now an extremely successful business man who finds his strength in The Lord. And check this out! His website\u2019s promo code is just the letter \u201cQ\u201d - I screen recorded it myself on the 2nd slide...... how many more \u201ccoincidences\u201d does it take? 3 years later & not one of these fake news reporters (who claim Q is a LARP & should WANT to associate a crazy label to the President) won\u2019t ask him about it! These demons have piss in their pants because they KNOW it\u2019s real. And asking the question only shines more light on their evil corruption.
