    "description": "All of these things, as well as countless other factors, show the similarities between school and prison.\n-\nYoung people are being set up for prison by being alienated and controlled in school. All of the different cliques and groups are much like the gangs in prison. The disgusting and unhealthy food choices are identical. -\nThere must be a change in order to inspire our future revolutionaries. School is clearly not the ideal place for one to gain knowledge, because the knowledge one seeks on their own is much more relevant and true than that is being taught to every child all across America.\n-\nWe must see a change in our school system to ever see a change in the prison industrial complex.\n-\nObviously there are stark differences between school and prison. Check out Ivan Illich\u2019s argument from in his book \u201cDeschooling Society\u201d (1971)\n-\n\u201cthat schools, like prisons, offices and factories have become industrialized institutions hence their similarity in the forms of rules, behaviours and organization.\u201d\n-\n-\n-\n-\n#goverment #nwo #population #control #newworldorder #elite #explorepage #pinealgland #nature #truthseeker #awake #anonymous  #conscious #collective #secretsocieties #openyoureyes #mindcontrol #awake #freedomthinker #illuminati #wokebreed #truthseeker  #seekthetruth #peoplepower #depopulation #conspiracy #woke #staywoke Follow: \ud83d\udca5 @wokebreed \ud83d\udca5",
