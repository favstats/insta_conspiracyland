    "description": "If you were to wear an N95 mask properly for about 5-8 minutes in a patient\u2019s room to let\u2019s say take your patient to the bathroom safely, administer medications, or do an assessment, you\u2019d probably have marks similar to these on your face\u2063\n\u2063\nNot only are you left with these temporary marks, but you quickly experience difficulty breathing after the first few minutes of applying the mask. You also start to heat up from the layers of gown, gloves, and eye shield\u2063\n\u2063\n...so here\u2019s a massive thank you to the ICU nurses, intensivists, and RTs who are wearing this PPE for an upwards of 30-40 minutes, if not longer, during invasive (aerosol-generating) bedside procedures. Whether they\u2019re dealing with an extubation or are all hands on deck during a code, they deserve a huge shout out for the physical exhaustion they endure when providing the safest & best care possible to their patients \ud83d\udc9b\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n*Disclaimer - this photo was taken at home after wearing one of my Dad\u2019s masks that he uses for work (he works in settings with fresh paint, dust, sanding, and welding)",
