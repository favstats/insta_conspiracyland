    "description": "#EvergreenAir is a #CIA front company for #chemtrail operations within the US, based out of #MaranaAirPark near #Tucson #Arizona and #McMinville #Oregon, near #Portland.\n\nA major missing piece of a grand conspiracy has been targeted by a drunk pilot. In a small town 30 miles east of the Pacific Ocean in Oregon is the center of a major global operation.\n\nAt a bar in McMinnville, Oregon, an inebriated pilot attempted to impress one of the pretty ladies with tales of his secret mission.\n\nThe pilot\u2019s pathetic attempt to portray himself as a Sean Connery or Daniel Craig caused him to (ante up) his importance and spill the secrets of the CIA\u2019s asset #EvergreenInternationalAviation.\n\nThe slurred revelations confirmed suspicions that Evergreen is part of the major crap dump on the planet. #Chemtrails made up aluminum, barium and other ingredients contribute to respiratory ills and change the acidity of the soil.\n\nEvergreen works from over a 100 bases and employees 4,500 people.

They can fly anywhere and not stay on a designated route.\n\nItalian industrialist Aurelio Peccei, who founded the #ClubofRome in 1968: \u201cIn searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of #globalwarming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill...\u201d \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe",
