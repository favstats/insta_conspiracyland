    "description": "Thoughts?\n\nThe #UnitedStatesofAmerica is basically closed for business, leaving citizens jobless, broke, and without options. We\u2019re facing restrictions on movement the likes of which our nation has never seen. The stores that are open have never fully restocked after the \u201c#panicbuying\u201d of previous weeks, leading to shelves barren of things like meat, flour, toilet paper, and rice.\n\nIt\u2019s only a matter of time before these issues combine to become the flashpoint that leads to an explosion of #civilunrest and violent crime.\n\nUnemployment skyrocketed, with 3.3 million claims last week, and the Fed estimates that number to climb to a whopping 47 million due to the virus. Many of these jobs may not come back after the #Covid19 virus has run its course through the nation \u2013 businesses small and large are going to be defaulting on their April rent payments, and many simply won\u2019t be able to catch up later.\n\nSo far, a lot of people in the area where I\u2019m staying seem to be treating this break of business like a surprise staycation. It\u2019s nice to see families out walking together, playing games, and spending time with the people they love.\n\nBut this happiness may be shortlived. Despite generous government-mandated disaster pay, unemployment, and stimulus checks, the money may not arrive in time for former employees, self-employed people, and gig workers to pay their personal bills. And when the money does arrive, for many folks it isn\u2019t going to be the same amount they were earning before the shutdowns. Most people don\u2019t have emergency funds, so things will be dire in short order.\n\nOf course, this affects landlord, mortgage companies, utility companies, retail businesses\u2026the list could go on and on.\n\nA lot of people are blaming \u201choarders\u201d and preppers for the shortages seen in stores. Of course, it\u2019s nonsense to blame preppers because we\u2019ve been buying our things over a course of years. And honestly, if it was only \u201cpanic buyers\u201d causing problems, wouldn\u2019t the stores be replenished by now? After all, people have hardly been able to shop for two weeks in many states due to #socialdistancing measures. \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe#OperationGothamShield",
