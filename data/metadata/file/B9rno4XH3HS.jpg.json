    "description": "History: His-Story -\nBlame Hollywood, the media, and even history books and teachers for perpetuating certain totally ridiculous or unfounded \"\"\"\"facts\"\"\"\" about history.\n-\nVikings didn\u2019t have have horns on their helmets, iron maidens aren\u2019t real, Columbus didn\u2019t prove the world is round, Napoleon wasn\u2019t short, Paul Revere didn\u2019t shout \u201cthe British are coming,\u201d Isaac Newton wasn\u2019t hit by an apple, Walt Disney didn\u2019t draw Mickey Mouse, Nero didn\u2019t fiddle over a burning Rome and \u201cEt tu, Brute?\u201c doesn\u2019t have the historical significance you think it does. -\n-\nAnd that\u2019s just the beginning, examples listed above are only basic examples. If you research enough you can find that many of our history \u201clessons\u201d and modern day beliefs about our past were completely fabricated. Wars, assassinations, mass genocide, Cultures, ancestors, Nephilim. Many things have been covered up and re written to hide the truth in our past historical events, discoveries and much much more.\n-\n-\nComment your thoughts below \ud83d\udcad\u2b07\ufe0f\n-\n-\nFollow my backup! @woke_breed \n#goverment #nwo #population #control #newworldorder #elite #explorepage #pinealgland #nature #truthseeker #awake #anonymous  #conscious #collective #secretsocieties #openyoureyes #mindcontrol #awake #freedomthinker #illuminati #wokebreed #truthseeker  #seekthetruth #peoplepower #depopulation #conspiracy #woke #staywoke Follow: \ud83d\udca5 @wokebreed \ud83d\udca5",
