    "description": "Thoughts?\n\nSmells like a #CoverUp to me. Is this an attempt to cover up the viral #EpsteinDidntKillHimself story? Of course.\n\nNotorious pedophile #JeffreyEpstein did not commit suicide in his jail cell but was strangled to death by Nicholas Tartaglione, according to John McAfee.\n\nSharing the details about what he claims to know about \u201cgovernment corruption\u201d on Twitter yesterday, McAfee decided to start with \u201cEpstein\u2019s murder\u201d and named Tartaglione as the man whose hands squeezed the life out of the convicted sex trafficker.\n\nTartaglione, a former New York police officer who was arrested and charged with murdering four men as part of a cocaine conspiracy, was Epstein\u2019s former cellmate and was questioned by police in relation to Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s July 2019 \u201csuicide attempt\u201d after which prison guards found the disgraced financier in the \u201cfetal position\u201d inside the cell.\n\nAs for people asking for proof of his claims, McAfee didn\u2019t offer any. The data security guru has a mixed record when it comes to prognostications recently. Bitcoin didn\u2019t hit $1 million at the start of 2020. But he was one of the first public figures to get it right about Russia not hacking the US election.\n\nAccording to McAfee, it\u2019s time for you to \u201cget off your butts and start digging\u201d to uncover the truth about Epstein\u2019s death. #LolitaExpress #PedoGate #PizzaGate #SpiritCooking #StopHumanTrafficking",
