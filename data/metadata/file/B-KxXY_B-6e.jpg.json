Chief Executive Jeffrey Bezos, who sold a total of $3.4 billion in Amazon shares in the first week  of February, shortly before the stock market peaked, allowing him to avoid paper losses of roughly $317 million if he had held the stock through March 20, according to the Journal analysis.\n\nThe sales represented roughly 3% of Mr. Bezos\u2019s Amazon holdings, according to the most recently available regulatory filings. He sold almost as much stock during the first week in February as he sold during the previous 12 months.\n\nBreitbart.com reports: The WSJ noted that Bezos was from the only executive that sold just before the coronavirus had a major effect on the market:\n\nWall Street executives also sold large dollar amounts, including Laurence Fink, CEO of BlackRock Inc., who sold $25 million of his company shares on Feb. 14, pre-empting potential losses of more than $9.3 million and Lance Uggla, CEO of IHS Markit Ltd., a data and analytics firm, who sold $47 million of his shares around Feb. 19. Those shares would have dropped in value by $19.2 million if Mr. Uggla had retained them. A spokesperson said the shares were sold under a preset plan. #Event201 #SocioEconomicReformation",
