The rumors came after #Trump retweeted a tweet from a right-wing conservative who called for Dr. Fauci to be fired after he said lives could have been saved if the government had acted more quickly.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nHowever, Hogan Gidley, the White House spokesperson, called the media chatter \u201dridiculous,\u201d adding, \u201dPresident Trump is not firing Dr. Fauci.
