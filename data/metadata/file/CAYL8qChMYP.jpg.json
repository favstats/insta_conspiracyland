The WHO has repeatedly denied the administration\u2019s charges.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Tedros said the organization would conduct a review of its \u201ctransparency\u201d and \u201caccountability\u201d amid the pandemic, which will begin at the \u201cearliest appropriate\u201d time. #Event201 #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda",
