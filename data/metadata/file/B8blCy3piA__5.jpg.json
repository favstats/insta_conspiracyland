    "description": "While some things out there are theories, one thing that is NOT, is the fact that... the term fossil fuels was made up by DuPont, Rockefeller, and other names of the \"\"global elite\"\" (global inferior) in 1892 in order to charge more for something which is the second most abundant liquid on earth, next to water.\n_\nYes indeed, take a moment look past your Feller' education system indoctrination and use the worlds largest video database to search up \"\"Origins of Oil\"\" one may be very surprised as to what the truth is.\n_\nThe Nazis wrote a book called \"\"the great oil conspiracy\"\" which is about their findings that oil replenishes and the American government covering it up from the media. Very interesting indeed.\n\nCaption and post inspired by @connecting_consciousness\n\nVideo speaker: Col. L.
