WHO general-director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesys said last week that \u201cnow is the time for us to be united against a common struggle\u201d in his rebuke of the president\u2019s claims.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen we\u2019re divided, the virus exploits the cracks between us.\u201d The director-general had previously criticised the president for politicising the virus, saying that \u201cnow is not the time for pointing fingers\u201d. #VaccineAgenda #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda #Event201",
