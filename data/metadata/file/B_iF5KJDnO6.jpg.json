    "description": "If not us, who? If not now, when? It\u2019s really time to become vocal & aggressive in a non-violent way when it comes to going against vaccines and our rights to not take them. People out there who try to come off as \u201cnot anti-vax\u201d are not doing us or themselves any favors.\n\nIt goes beyond comprehension to have to even explain to people today that it is a natural born human right to not have an intrusive practice such as injecting genetically modified substances straight into the vein. It is a human right to be sick, to die, and to be left alone if one wants to.\n\nUnderstand that the most dangerous religion of all is the religion of science. It\u2019s not real science, it\u2019s state-backed science that doesn\u2019t get questioned, because it comes from the authorities. They\u2019ve talked about bringing in a. Scientific dictatorship and keeping it FOREVER. We must push these guys back at the very least. It\u2019s time to commit your life to defending your freedom & standing up for what\u2019s right.\u00a0 Bill Gates is a scientific dictator \u2014 a technocrat. Unelected and more powerful than any president. He\u2019s funded & participated in genocidal projects ranging from GMO foods, Vaccines, Planned Parenthood,\u00a0 Geo-engineering, and in the future it will be forced abortions by the government to control the population #\u2019s. The religion of science that they\u2019ve given us tells us that the world has too many people \u2014 and that we\u2019re destroying the earth \u2014 all for a good reason.\u00a0 Stop believing their lies. \ud83d\udc49 @TruthisTerrorism \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaa\ud83e\udde0 #saynotobillgates #arrestbillgates #exposebillgates",
