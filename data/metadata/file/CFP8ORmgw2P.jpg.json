    "description": "Fox News had a crazy awkward moment on \"\"Outnumbered\"\" with Harris Faulkner, Melissa Francis, and Marie Harf with guest Newt Gingrich. They were having a conversation about lawlessness in Democrat run cities. Toward the end, Newt Gingrich brings up how George Soros-funded elected officials are complicit in the chaos by refusing to convict the lawbreakers. Then they cut him off. But why? This is not a conspiracy theory. Soros and Soros-backed groups are most certainly behind lawless far-leftists in office. AOC and the \"\"The Squad\"\" (all members and Pramila Jayapal included.) Fox News itself has written about thar fact before. So what was this all about? Sounds like Rupert Murdoch's boys are tightening the liberal screws on Fox News.\n\n.\n.\n.\n#soros #georgesoros #justicedemocrats #opensocietyfoundation #foxnews #aoc #thesquad #outnumbered #fnc #fox #riots #protests #blackliesmatter #blacklivesmatter",
