    "description": "Twitter just suspended me for a week. Can anybody tell me where I broke the rules on \u201cpromoting or encouraging suicide or self harm\u201d in any of the 3 tweets they made me remove? Those 3 tweets had a combined 50,000 likes & every single one of them mentions an effective drug that has been curing the Coronavirus called Hydroxychloroquine. In the second one I\u2019m even warning people NOT to drink fish tank cleaner with pop like the one idiot did. They don\u2019t want people to know the damning truth that a simple antiviral used for malaria works against the Coronavirus. Big pharma, The CDC, WHO & many others who are incredibly corrupt sectors of The Swamp do not want us knowing about this.... and now @jaysather just got his Mailchimp AND PayPal deleted today for breaking rules they won\u2019t even specify.
