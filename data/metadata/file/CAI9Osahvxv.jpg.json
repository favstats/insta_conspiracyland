    "description": "Dr. Ivette C. Lozano from #Dallas, #Texas recently addressed a crowd during a rally to express her frustration over successfully treating #COVID patients.\n\nShe claims that patients were coming to her because they were being turned away from hospital emergency rooms and other doctors, and were simply being told to go home and #quarantine themselves \u201cto save the rest of society\u201d without getting any treatment.\n\nDr. Lozano said she received no help from the American Medical Association, the Texas Medical Association, or the Dallas County Medical Association on how to treat COVID patients.\n\nShe explains how she heard about #Hydroxychloroquine from the #PresidentTrump press briefings, and how this drug had been used successfully to treat #COVID19 patients in other countries. It is a drug with a 60-year history of being safe, and it is inexpensive.\n\nSo she started prescribing it to her patients, and they were feeling better and symptom-free within 24 hours.\n\nBut the pharmacies apparently became aware of how much she was prescribing, and that\u2019s when the troubles began.\n\nDr. Lozano has been practicing medicine for more than 29 years, and she said: \u201cFor some reason, those bureaucrats that are standing next to our President, that think that they know more about medicine than I do, are telling me I can\u2019t use it!\u201d",
