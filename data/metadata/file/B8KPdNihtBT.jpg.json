    "description": "Thoughts?\n\nA new, deadly #drug is being found in #Louisiana for the first time.\n\nOfficials say the drug is so powerful, just touching it could kill you.\n\nThey\u2019re calling this super drug \u201c#graydeath.\u201d \u201cThe public recognizes a lot of the drugs that we deal with. This is a new one,\u201d David Spencer, spokesperson for the St. Mary Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office said. \u201cGray death\u201d is #heroin that has been cut with #Fentanyl, according to Spencer, and it is deadly. \u201cBe aware of the color. It looks like chunks of concrete,\u201d Spencer warned. \u201cGray death\u201d first started appearing in #Alabama and #Georgia in 2017. It then moved to #Ohio and #Pennsylvania.\n\nNow, deputies say it\u2019s here in Louisiana. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to touch this. If it all possible, you don\u2019t even want to put it on your hands,\u201d Spencer said.\n\nThe drug is reportedly 10,000 times more potent than morphine. Just touching the drug could kill you. \u201cYou would really hate to see somebody innocent touch this not knowing what it is or a child touch that now knowing what it is,\u201d Spencer added. \u201cWe just definitely just want to educate the public so they know, hey, this is a new thing.\u201d Officials say if you come across this drug, you should not pick it up or even touch it. Instead, you should report it to authorities.\n\nThe first sample of \u201cgray death\u201d in Louisiana was recently recovered from suspects from the Lake Charles area who were traveling through St. Mary Parish.",
