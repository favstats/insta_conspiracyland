D. in respiratory mechanics, borrowed an idea conceived by #American doctors Greg Neyman and Charlene Babcock in 2006 to double the capacity of a single ventilator. According to CBC the idea was tested successfully following the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting. Babcock eventually created a how-to video explaining how the DIY \u201cupgrade\u201d works.\n\nIn just ten minutes, Gauthier used extra tubing to double the number of patients that could be ventilated at the hospital.\n\nThe way the system works is that the two patients simultaneously connected to the ventilator must be roughly the same size and with the same lung capacity. Multiple hoses are then attached to the one ventilator, which is then run at several times its normal power.\n\nWhile imperfect, Gauthier said that \u201cif it comes to last resort, I\u2019m prepared to use it.\u201d Gauthier\u2019s colleague, Alan Drummond, excitedly shared images of the rigged ventilator on Twitter, jokingly calling Gauthier \u201can evil genius.\u201d He wrote: \u201cSo in ten minutes the evil genius who is one of our GP anesthetists (with a PhD in diaphragmatic mechanics) increased our rural hospitals ventilator capacity from one to nine!!!\u201d \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe",
