Most of the posts are either fact-checked or in the process thereof. To me, when situations like this happen, that lets me know that regardless of if it\u2019s true or not, fact-checked or fake news, they can\u2019t have this information consolidated and out there - Better yet, we can\u2019t put it out there.\n\nFollow our back ups:\n@NoizceEra\n@Freedoms_Faction\n@Factions_Of_Freedom\n@Fellowship_And_Freedom\n@Liberation_Legion\n@Paradox_Radio\n\nWe are unable to go live on our primary account because of this. They did not specify for how long, but thankfully because we are on multiple platforms, with multiple accounts which have the ability to livestream \ud83d\ude44 We\u2019ll be alright.",
