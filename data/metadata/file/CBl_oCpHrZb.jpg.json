    "description": "This video was in regards to his \u201cYummy\u201d video. There was rumors going around saying it was about sex trafficking. That\u2019s why Justin Bieber started posting pictures of babies on his Instagram saying \u201cyummy\u201d under them. He was vocal about what happened to him also. I wish people would understand that you cannot EVER maintain fame and fortune on your own. This industry is not about talent! It is all about what you\u2019re willing to do. That\u2019s it! That is one of the first questions they ask you before you sign your deal. #hollyweirdisevil",
