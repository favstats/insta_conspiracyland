    "description": "I\u2019m not playing games anymore. Enough is enough. I won\u2019t sit by idly while these traitors try to shut us up so they can destroy this country. I\u2019m going to reach out to Nick Sandmann\u2019s lawyer here shortly & see if they will take on this case. I will fight this all the way through the Supreme Court if that\u2019s what it takes. Let\u2019s come together & put the the heat on our politicians & these corrupt tech giants. WE HOLD THE POWER. Not them. And now it\u2019s time to feel our collective wrath in the biggest & fastest growing lawsuit of all time. I\u2019m just trying to figure out my next step. Obviously this is going to cost a lot of money, so do I start a gofundme to pay for legal fees? No matter what happens, every single dime of that fund would go towards taking these traitors down via the legal system. And if there\u2019s any left over what should I do with it? Give it to the Trump campaign? Donate to charity? I know that I\u2019m not going to take that money for myself. We have the chance to make history together, restore justice, & make this country better than anybody ever thought possible!!!!",
