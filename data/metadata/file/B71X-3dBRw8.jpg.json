To be clear, the Center for Health Security and partners did not make a prediction during our tabletop exercise. For the scenario, we modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction.\u201d The #WorldHealthOrganization (WHO) has declined to call the situation a global emergency at this time. However, the #Geneva-based organization stated that it considers China\u2019s current situation a health emergency. As of Sunday night WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was on his way to Beijing to \u201cstrengthen our partnership\u201d with China \u201cin providing further protection against the outbreak,\u201d according to Reuters. \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe#Biowarfare #PopulationControl",
