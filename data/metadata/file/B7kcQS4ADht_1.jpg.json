    "description": "So check this out.\n\nYesterday I created a backup Facebook page because I was curious to see how bad they were shadow-banning my main page from my followers.\n\nAnd the post I made on the new page with only a couple thousand followers is doing ALMOST as good as the post on my main page with over 240k more.\n\nThey even say the post with only 600 shares is doing better than NINETY PERCENT of the posts on my main page.\n\nThat\u2019s laughable.\n\nFacebook is hiding me from hundreds of thousands of people\u2019s timelines because they don\u2019t like the exposing truths I post interfering with their leftist agenda.\n\nCensoring conservative thought like this from social media is one of the ways they interfere in our elections.\n\nA senior research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research & Technology even testified in Congress saying Google rigging their search engine swung at least 2.6 to 10 million votes for Hillary.",
