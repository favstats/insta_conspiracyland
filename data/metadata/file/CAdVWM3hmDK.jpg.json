YouTube has now censored Dr. Knut Wittowski, for daring to question the government\u2019s tyranny.\n\nBack at the beginning of April, SHTFPlan highlighted this censored doctor\u2019s take on the lockdowns, and why he says they will not work. More than a month later, he\u2019s been proven correct while some #Americans still can\u2019t see what\u2019s right in front of them: this whole thing was planned for domination and control of humanity by the very select few elitists.\n\nDr. Knut M. Wittkowski, former head of biostatistics, epidemiology, and research design at #RockefellerUniversity, says YouTube removed a video of him talking about the virus that had racked up more than 1.3 million views.\n\nWittkowski, 65, is a ferocious critic of the nation\u2019s current steps to fight the coronavirus. He has derided social distancing, saying it only prolongs the virus\u2019 existence and has attacked the current lockdown as mostly unnecessary.\n\nWittkowski, who holds two doctorates in computer science and medical biometry, believes the #coronavirus should be allowed to create \u201c#herdimmunity,\u201d and that short of a vaccine, the pandemic will only end after it has sufficiently spread through the population. \u201cWith all respiratory diseases, the only thing that stops the disease is herd immunity. About 80% of the people need to have had contact with the virus, and the majority of them won\u2019t even have recognized that they were infected,\u201d he says in the now-deleted video. \u2013New York Post\n\nMore of Wittkowskit\u2019s exact quotes about the coronavirus plandemic can be found in our article, although the video, which we linked, will not be available thanks to YouTube \u201cprotecting us\u201d from information.\n\nPeople all over the world continue to bow to tyranny under the false illusion that they\u2019ll be \u201csafe\u201d and the suffering will be immense if we do not stop it... \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe#CoViD1984 #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda",
