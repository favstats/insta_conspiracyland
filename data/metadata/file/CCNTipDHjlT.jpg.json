    "description": "FOUND THIS!!! It made so much sense to me!!! Just think about it!!! Really think about it!!! Where did most people learn about their history? School! Who taught the history? The white man! \ud83e\udd14 seems very suspect to me!! Show me the slave ships!! Explain how a minority of people can colonise so many many countries where the majority were people of colour. How can such a dominant race just be wiped out like that?! They couldn\u2019t do that to black people now and they have a checkered history of blanks. Yet when they were kings, queens, inventors, they could just enslave them for 400 years and degrade them in front of their people?! Sounds like a \u2018White Fairytale\u2019 to me\ud83e\uddd0 wake tf up people!!! We are being manipulated on a large scale!!! I don\u2019t know what the truth is but they haven\u2019t given it to us yet. They are too scared!!! #revolution #is #coming #slaves #history #agenda21 #blackpower #truth #gossip #celeb #andrenochrome #nwo #politics #police #policebrutality #hillaryclinton #obama #ellendegeneres #justiceforbreonnataylor #justiceforahmaud #justiceforchildren #future #conspiracy",
