    "description": "I should\u2019ve known something was fishy. I\u2019m not even going to lie even I fell for that media manipulation bull this time and I usually never do. It\u2019s very easy for them to twist a story from a 3rd world country because not a lot of people in Amerikkka have access to the REAL news that\u2019s happening there. A couple of years ago when I was in the Philippines, my mom called me and asked where I was and if I was safe and I said why? And she told me the US news was saying that there was an active shooter at a mall that was 20 min from where I was staying in the Philippines. But when we heard the real news in the Philippines, it was just a fire that broke out at the mall. Just a little example of how the media twist EVERYTHING LITTLE THING! #hollyweirdisevil #iran #trump",
