    "description": "-\nEvidence suggesting the Chinese government is hiding the true extent of the coronavirus outbreak is mounting.\nExiled Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui says that the government is cremating 1,200 corpses a day in Wuhan alone.\n\nOfficial data indicate that the Communist Party of China (CPC) has successfully contained the coronavirus outbreak. But evidence suggesting that the CPC is lying keeps mounting. Even the CDC now believes China is severely underreporting the data.\n-\nGuo\u2019s Infection Claims Might Be True\nChina has done a terrible job of containing the spread of coronavirus. The CPC\u2019s authoritarian measures may have even led to a rise in infections.\n-\nThe exponential rise in coronavirus cases has overwhelmed hospitals in Wuhan. Since hospitals are out of beds, people suspected of having coronavirus are forced into mass quarantine centers.\n-\nTo contain the spread, people who either exhibit symptoms or those who have come in close contact with confirmed coronavirus cases are put into isolation centers.\n-\nGuo\u2019s Coronavirus Death Claims May Be Overblown. Mounting evidence proves that the CPC is lying about the true extent of the coronavirus outbreak. But this doesn\u2019t verify Guo Wengui\u2019s claims. Just because China has a certain number of portable incinerators, it doesn\u2019t mean they are operational 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n-\nAlso, it\u2019s possible that the incinerators are not exclusively used for human cremation. Some of them could be burning animal carcasses.\n-\nThe situation is grimmer than what the CPC is letting on. But the truth probably lies somewhere between the official statistics and Guo\u2019s claims. -\n-\nFollow my Backup @woke_breed \n#goverment #nwo #population #control #newworldorder #elite #explorepage #pinealgland #nature #truthseeker #awake #anonymous  #conscious #collective #secretsocieties #openyoureyes #mindcontrol #awake #freedomthinker #illuminati #wokebreed #truthseeker  #seekthetruth #peoplepower #depopulation #conspiracy #woke #staywoke Follow: \ud83d\udca5 @wokebreed \ud83d\udca5",
