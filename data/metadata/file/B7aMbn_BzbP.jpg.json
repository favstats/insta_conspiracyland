It's been enforced for several hundred years now. It's easy to understand. It says what it means, and means what it says. And the last time I read the Declaration of Independence, it specifically reminds all of us that we're endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights, which means God-given.\"\"\"\" \"\"\"\"Among these, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\"\"\"\" Kester continued. \"\"\"\"And that governments are instituted among men specifically to secure our #Godgivenrights. And it says when government becomes destructive to these ends \u2014 meaning that they go above and beyond trying to secure our liberties and trying to take them \u2014 it's the right of the people to alter or abolish that government, either by voting or ultimately, God forbid, to use our Second Amendment rights to protect ourselves from tyranny.\"\"\"\" Deputy Kester then called for the Board of Commissioners to join the counties of Cherokee, Lincoln, Rowan, Stokes, Surry, and Wilkes in becoming Second Amendment sanctuaries.",
