    "description": "Reposted from @victormjackson I had a chance to pray for more people than I thought I would be able to. Prayed for many people individually and there were hundreds in this setting. Preached Christ in the place that tragedy happened. I shared the gospel. Jesus loves policeman, black, white, Spanish, Asian, and every other ethnicity. Our answer is in him. Told them how to connect with local churches. - #regrann  #Godwins #Pray #GodSaveAmerica #DarkToLIGHT #TheGREATAWAKENING #UnitedNOTDivided #prayforamerica #USA #georgesoros #GeorgeFloyd #Deepstate #cabal #peace #news #love #Jesus #Maga #Minneapolis #TheBaQery #Qanon#PatriotsAwakened #unity @realdonaldtrump",
