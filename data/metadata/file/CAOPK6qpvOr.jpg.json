I ask you, leader (of parliament), to be our spokesperson who will give advice to President Conte: Next time you receive a phone call from the \u201cphilanthropist\u201d Bill Gates, forward it directly to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. \u201cIf you won\u2019t do this for us, tell us how we should define you, the \u2018friendly lawyer\u2019 who takes orders from a criminal,\u201d said Cunial. #arrestbillgates #nonewnormal",
