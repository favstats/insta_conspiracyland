    "description": "This is my 3rd and last post regarding the agenda to divide us. This video builds upon the last one.  I'll repeat what I said with the last post...but watch this video.  It's powerful. \nFor anyone who questions the power of the mindset of success, this video demonstrates it. No victims mentality here. Remember, where attention goes, energy flows!  So put your attention where you want your energy to go. This is just one of the reasons that Morgan Freeman is a stud, and a source of inspiration to many.\n\nFrom last post:\n1. Bad cops should be held accountable for their crimes, and as far as I'm concerned, thrown in jail for life or worse, if they have violated their mandate of protecting the public.\n2. A bad cop that kills an innocent person, should have to pay the price and if there was ever a reason for capital punishment, this would be it in my opinion!\n3. Any cop that kills ANY innocent person (black or white) MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE!\n\nBut guys, don't buy into this narrative that creates division among us. They have constantly tried to divide us, based on religion, ethnicity, color, creed, nationality, political party, etc. Do NOT let anyone divide us anymore. The ones with the agenda against us are trying desperately to create as much division as possible. Do NOT allow it to happen.\n\nWatch this video and understand what the truth is...because when we understand the truth, no one can take advantage of us.\n\n#covid19 #covidconspiracy #corona #patriots #patriot #patriotic #patrioticnation #DrButtar #AHEADMAP #AdvancedMedicine #AdvancedMedicineConference #IADFW #Fitness #Longevity #livelonger #livehealthy #power #facts #knowledge #truth #empowerment #livefree #livefreeordie #populationcontrol #whistleblower #soldiers #wechangetheworld #healthfreedom #health #freedom",
