Much to the chagrin of the tyrants who claim ownership over the bodies of others, the bill that would have eliminated religious exemptions to mandatory vaccinations failed to pass the #NewJersey state legislature.\n\nAccording to reports, the bill was canceled in the Senate before the vote because lawmakers knew they lacked the passing votes.
