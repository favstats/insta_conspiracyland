    "description": "When President Trump retweeted a call to fire Dr. Anthony Fauci on Sunday night, he jolted a fringe conservative movement that viewed the boost as an acknowledgment of its cause.\u2063\n\u2063\nAnd the #FireFauci gang was ready with a replacement: Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai.\u2063\n\u2063\n\"\"Dr. Shiva\u201d as his fans call him, is a controversial scientist and long-shot Massachusetts Senate candidate who is pushing a variety of claims that range from dubious to medically disputed to outright false. He has argued that a strict vitamin regimen can prevent and treat the coronavirus \u2014 an unsubstantiated view at odds with the medical community and existing research. And he claims Fauci is a deep-state plant hellbent on \u201cforced and mandatory vaccines\u201d to support \u201cBig Pharma\u201d \u2014 a claim for which there is no evidence.\u2063\n\u2063\nYet Ayyadurai, who is not a medical doctor, has the imprimatur of several degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an online fan base among the people leading the movement to oust Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert. That includes DeAnna Lorraine, who suddenly ended up in the spotlight after Trump retweeted her call to #FireFauci. Lorraine, a former challenger for Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s California House seat who has regularly retweeted QAnon conspiracies, is using her newfound perch to stump for Ayyadurai.
