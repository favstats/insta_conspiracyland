    "description": "I know this is a graphic message, but I wanted to show you guys a sample of the hateful messages I get on an every day basis. These people are absolutely miserable. And that comes from the spiritual void of not knowing Jesus or their Father in Heaven. They mindlessly chase & consume the material things in life that will leave them feeling empty & without a purpose. And I just want them to know that God loves you. And so does Jesus. It doesn\u2019t matter what you\u2019ve done in the past, the gift of eternal salvation is free & you can repent from your sins & become born again at any time. Just repeat this prayer with me - \u201cDear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, & I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins & rose from the dead. I turn from my sins. I want to trust & follow You as my Lord & Savior.\u201d Confess this with your mouth, believe it in your heart, & you will be saved. But don\u2019t forget to leave your sinful behaviors in the past & walk with Jesus. I also want to let you guys know that I get WAY more positive messages than negative ones & I can\u2019t thank you enough for your support! One race, one family, one country under God. Where we go one we go all. #WWG1WGA #TheBaQery #DarkToLight #atheGreatAwakening #GodWins #PatriotsAreInControl #TrustThePlan #PanicInDC #Qanon #TheStormIsUponUs #NothingCanStopWhatsComing \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc38\ud83c\udf7f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8",
