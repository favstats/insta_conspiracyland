    "description": "Thoughts?\n\nA video out of the UK shows police officers entering a man\u2019s house after breaking in to check whether he was having a social gathering in violation of #coronavirus lockdown rules. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a call that there might be something going on here so we need to double check,\u201d says a female officer as she enters the man\u2019s residence. \u201cWe need to check the rooms to make sure there\u2019s nothing going on,\u201d she adds before the man responds, \u201cWhat are you doing in my house?\u201d The officer claims they received a call about a \u201cdisturbance,\u201d which was almost certainly a neighbor grassing up the man because they thought he had invited friends around to his home.\n\nThe man is clearly irate that the police have smashed in his door and he berates them with foul language throughout.\n\nThe four officers, who clearly don\u2019t have a warrant, then proceed to check the house as the man continues to swear at them and tell them to leave.\n\nAfter the officers leave, the man complains, \u201cFucking idiots, broke my fucking door, look at the fucking state of this,\u201d as she shows the shattered door.\n\nVideo clips of similar incidents are now appearing almost every day as police become more zealous in enforcing the lockdown.\n\nLast week, we highlighted an incident during which a female police officer told a family that their children couldn\u2019t play outside in their own front garden.\n\nThis prompted a response from the government clarifying that this was in fact totally legal. #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda #Event201 #PopulationControl #Agenda21 #Agenda2030",
