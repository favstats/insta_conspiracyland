    "description": "Never Forget when this entire community was destroyed! By noon on June 1, white rioters had burned down 35 city blocks in Greenwood: dozens of black-owned businesses that had anchored the neighborhood, hundreds of homes, and half a dozen churches. Ten thousand Greenwood residents were left homeless.\n\nFifteen years of black wealth and self-sufficiency were razed in one night. In the aftermath, the Tulsa City Commission passed fire ordinances that blocked the rebuilding of Greenwood. So many of Tulsa\u2019s black residents had no choice but to just\u2026leave. This is what happens when you pose a threat to the \u201cElite Poop Eaters\u201d economy. #hollyweirdisevil",
