    "description": "Thoughts?\n\nThe Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York (NYCPBA) has called for officers to stop enforcing #socialdistancing orders, saying that politicians have left them hanging to deal with the backlash on their own.\n\nThe union called city leaders \u201ccowards\u201d who have left the police to \u201cfend for themselves.\u201d \u201cThe NYPD needs to get cops out of the social distancing enforcement business altogether,\u201d PBA President Patrick Lynch said in a statement. \u201cThe cowards who run this city have given us nothing but vague guidelines and mixed messages, leaving the cops on the street corners to fend for ourselves.\u201d Lynch also blasted politicians for releasing real criminals while discouraging them from properly doing their jobs to enforce laws against things like fare evasion. \u201cMeanwhile, those same politicians are still watering down our laws, releasing real criminals and discouraging proactive enforcement of fare evasion and quality of life issues,\u201d Lynch said.\n\nThe statement comes after a video went viral of a violent clash between law enforcement and citizens who were not complying with the social distancing orders.\n\nThe department has faced significant backlash over the footage. \u201cOfficers instructed the group disperse and while most complies, some refused. As officers approached, they observed a bag of alleged #marijuana in plain view. Subject #1 immediately became aggressive towards officers and resisted arrest. While attempting to effect this arrest, Subject #2 attempted to intervene and prevent the arrest of Subject #1 and was also placed under arrest,\u201d the department said in a statement about the video. #PoliceState #CoViD1984",
