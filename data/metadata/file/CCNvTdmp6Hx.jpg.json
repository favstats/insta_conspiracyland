Where did most people learn about their history? School! Who taught the history? The white man! \ud83e\udd14 seems very suspect to me!! Show me the slave ships!! Explain how a minority of people can colonise so many many countries where the majority were people of colour. How can such a dominant race just be wiped out like that?! They couldn\u2019t do that to black people now and they have a checkered history of blanks. Yet when they were kings, queens, inventors, they could just enslave them for 400 years and degrade them in front of their people?! Sounds like a \u2018White Fairytale\u2019 to me\ud83e\uddd0 wake tf up people!!! We are being manipulated on a large scale!!! I don\u2019t know what the truth is but they haven\u2019t given it to us yet,They are too scared!!! #Unite @wel_come2jamrock\ud83c\udf34 #revolution #is #coming #slaves #history #agenda21 #blackpower #truth #gossip #celeb #andrenochrome #nwo #politics #police #policebrutality #hillaryclinton #obama #ellendegeneres #justiceforbreonnataylor #justiceforahmaud #justiceforchildren #future #conspiracy #One_Love #YAH_LOVE\ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf2",
