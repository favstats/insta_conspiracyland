    "description": "URGENT: I have been sent so many messages about this subject in the last few days and heard such heart breaking stories. If you feel it in your heart to say what you feel,  then a petition has been released with Federal parliament to stop the mandatory injection for nursing home visitors.  There are apparently studies linking the flu injection to an increased possibility of other illnesses.  Someone may like to produce that evidence if there is any below in the comments?  For the record, I have signed this and support this petition. Also for the record I am not anti v as many people have assumed. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f Feel free to share if you desire and feel free to sign or not sign.  The decision is yours always.  I send love to you all, regardless of what your beliefs are. \ud83c\udf08 #healthfreedom \nNote: Petition closes 10 Jun 2020.\nIMPORTANT: Please make sure you check your email to validate the signature, otherwise will not go through.\nThis petition is really important, and is something federal members and cabinet have to regard.
