    "description": "Reposted from @darealsaucemoney I wonder if Oprah is ever going to explain these relationships? Instead of building up Black men, she takes aim every chance she gets to discredit them.  What about her ties with these pedophiles and rapist? Let\u2019s challenge her to explain those relationships, where woman and children are being RAPED, KILLED, and HARVESTED for ANDRENOCROME by her constituents. The violation of CHILDREN and the shedding of their innocent blood is UNFATHOMABLE!  If you\u2019re knowingly in business with these sick bastards, and you\u2019 stand by idly or turn a blind eye, then you\u2019re just as guilty. So Oprah might not have a bracelet on her ankle, but she dam sure has these relationships on her resume.  So let\u2019s challenge her to explain this. Until then, we ain\u2019t letting her, and nobody else off the hook. #rapist #pedohiles #oprah #johnofgod #harveyweinstein #andrenochrome #innocent #children #guilty #convicted - #regrann",
