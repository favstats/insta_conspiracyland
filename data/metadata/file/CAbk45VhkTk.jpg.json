    "description": "Certain #cannabis strains may have the potential to protect the body against #Covid19 infection, as revealed by researchers at the #UniversityofLethbridge earlier this month.\n\nAfter studying over 400 #marijuana strains, the #Canadian researchers found around a dozen of which show promise in protecting users from becoming infected with the #coronavirus, a discovery which will surely cause #cannabis users to rejoice.\n\nThe treatment works by limiting the number of virus receptors in which Covid-19 attaches to, such as those in the lungs, intestines, and mouth. \u201cIf they can reduce the number of receptors, there\u2019s much less chance of getting infected,\u201d said lead researcher Dr. Igor Kovalchuk. \u201c[As] a number of them have reduced the number of these (virus) receptors by 73 per cent, the chance of it getting in is much lower.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Kovalchuk, Biological Scientist\n\nScientists still have not found a proper balance between #tetrahydrocannabinol (#THC) and #cannabidiol (#CBD) content when used for this purpose, but they generally favor CBD, in part because of its anti-inflammatory properties. \u201cIt will take a long time to find what the active ingredient is \u2014 there may be many \u2026 [but] we focus more on the higher CBD because people can take higher doses and not be impaired.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Kovalchuk\n\nCannabis-based products may soon be used in conjunction with other promising therapies like Intravenous #VitaminC and #Hydroxychloroquine for treating and preventing coronavirus.\n\nReferring to cannabis, Kovalchuk states, \u201cit would be cheaper for people and have a lot less side-effects,\u201d says Kovalchuk, but there haven\u2019t yet been any clinical trials, only research into the effect of cannabis compounds on \u2018artificial human 3D tissue models,\u2019 which sets up a significant hurdle for the research.\n\nHowever, scientists in Israel have also started clinical trials to research the potential impact that CBD has in repairing Covid-19 damaged cells. \u201cOur work could have a huge influence \u2014 there aren\u2019t many drugs that have the potential of reducing infection by 70 to 80 per cent,\u201d said Dr. Kovalchuk. \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe",
