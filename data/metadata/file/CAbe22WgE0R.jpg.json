    "description": "Investigators in Ukraine have launched a probe into former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden over allegations that he pressured Ukrainian officials to fire the country\u2019s top prosecutor in 2016, according to a report.\n\nThe Ukrainian probe was launched in response to a court order, after the ousted prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, made an appeal for action in the matter, Shokin\u2019s attorney, Oleksandr Teleshetsky, told The Washington Post. \u201cThey need to investigate this. They have no other alternative,\u201d Teleshetsky told the Post. \u201cThey are required to do this by the decision of the court. If they don't, then they violate a whole string of procedural norms.\u201d #obamagate #wwg1wga #california #qanonarmy #qanonfollowthewhiterabbit #wwg1wga\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 #wwg1wga\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 #wwg1wgaworldwide \n#qanon\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 #qproof #qsentme\ud83e\udd2b #qanon #wwb1wba",
