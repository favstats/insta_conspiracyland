    "description": "I made a post that was VERY controversial apparently, but well received.  So let me make sure I'm clear:\n1. Bad cops should be held accountable for their crimes, and as far as I'm concerned, thrown in jail for life or worse, if they have violated their mandate of protecting the public.\n2. A bad cop that kills an innocent person, should have to pay the price and if there was ever a reason for capital punishment, this would be it in my opinion!\n3. Any cop that kills ANY innocent person (black or white) MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE!\n\nBut guys, don't buy into this narrative that creates division among us.  They have constantly tried to divide us, based on religion, ethnicity, color, creed, nationality, political party, etc.  Do NOT let anyone divide us anymore.  The ones with the agenda against us are trying desperately to create as much division as possible.  Do NOT allow it to happen.\n\nWatch this video and understand what the truth is...because when we understand the truth, no one can take advantage of us.\n\n#covid19 #covidconspiracy #corona #patriots #patriot #patriotic #patrioticnation #DrButtar #AHEADMAP #AdvancedMedicine #AdvancedMedicineConference #IADFW #Fitness #Longevity #livelonger #livehealthy #power #facts #knowledge #truth #empowerment #livefree #livefreeordie #populationcontrol #whistleblower #soldiers #wechangetheworld #healthfreedom #health #freedom",
