    "description": "The 9/11 Ritual\n\nOn the day of 9/11, George W. Bush visited the Booker Elementary School in Florida and was sitting in a chair reading 'The Pet Goat' (the book was upside down \ud83e\udd14). While he was reading this book, the elementary school children were reciting these words: Kite, Hit, Steel, Plane, Must.\n\n9/11 is playing out while these kids are chanting 5 words and 3 of the words happen to be directly linked with the events of 9/11...Hit Steel Plane.\n\nIn the video, they actually break right after this and this is the exact time where the man comes and whispers into President's Bush's ear that the nation is under attack. The word kite is also interesting considering Kite has multiple meanings...like \"\"Let's go fly a kite\"\". Check kiting or check fraud, floating funds from one account to another account without actually having the funds in either account (which is very interesting with Rumsfeld's announcement the day before 9/11 where they were missing 2.3 trillion dollars). Then there is also the term \"\"kite' - which is an Egyptian bird linked with the Goddess Isis used in ceremonies to bring back the dead.",
