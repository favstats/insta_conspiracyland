    "description": "Thoughts?\n\nAfter the death of #EricGarner in 2014 shook the nation, the phrase \u201c#Icantbreathe\u201d has become a chilling symbol for violence doled out at the hands of the state. TFTP has reported on multiple instances in which entirely peaceful and often innocent people have muttered those words just before police officers squeeze the last bit of life from their bodies. Tragically, as the video below shows us, this is still happening.\n\nMonday night, police officers in Minneapolis responded to a call over an alleged \u201cforgery in progress.\u201d When cops arrived, they found a man, who appeared to be in his 40s \u2014 who \u201cfit the description.\u201d \u201cOfficers were advised that the suspect was sitting on top of a blue car and appeared to be under the influence,\u201d the police statement said. \u201cTwo officers arrived and located the suspect, a male believed to be in his 40s, in his car. He was ordered to step from his car. \u201cAfter he got out, he physically resisted officers. Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress. Officers called for an ambulance.\u201d The man died soon after, the statement said, adding, \u201cAt no time were weapons of any type used by anyone involved in this incident. \u2026 Body worn cameras were on and activated during this incident.\u201d As the disturbing video shows, the above description by police leaves out many details. The man, who had only fit the description of a forgery suspect was thrown to the ground by police and held under a police officer\u2019s knee for five minutes. Five minutes with a knee on his neck. \u201cMy stomach hurts. My neck hurts. Everything hurts. \u2026 (I need) water or something. Please. Please. I can\u2019t breathe, officer. \u2026 I cannot breathe. I cannot breathe.\u201d That was followed by more groaning and as the last moments of life left this man\u2019s body, officers did not help him up or remove the knee from his neck.\n\nRead More: [https://thefreethoughtproject.com/police-kneel-mans-neck-dies/] #PoliceState #PoliceAccountability #PoliceBrutality #KillerCops #AlwaysFilmThePolice",
