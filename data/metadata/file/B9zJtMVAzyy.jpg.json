    "description": "I feel guilty because I know what a rude awakening feels like. And I wouldn\u2019t wish that upon anybody - even those who have mocked & ridiculed me in the past. I\u2019m over it. I hope more people will start looking into the Q drops for themselves & not take second-hand opinions on it. You might not like what you find because there\u2019s some deep, dark & heavy shit that will he revealed to you. But ultimately, that truth will set you free. And perhaps it will even lead you to finding God & accepting Jesus like it did for me. That\u2019s what gives me peace during these otherwise confusing times. We all need to wake up together to understand the absolute evil that has been operating behind the scenes. Ripping the band aid off & becoming aware of an uncomfortable reality is the only way we can hold these demons accountable & move on in a safer world together. And I call them demons because they are. Once you really dive into Q you will see what I am talking about. We are not only doing this to save humanity, but to save our children from the unspeakable torture they have been subject to.... May God bless you all & give you comfort & wisdom. #WWG1WGA #TheGreatAwakening #DarkToLight #PatriotsAreInControl #GodWins #PanicInDC #TheStormIsUponUs",
