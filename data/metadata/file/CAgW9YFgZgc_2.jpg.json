    "description": "YouTube just deleted my last video where I did nothing but ASK QUESTIONS regarding COVID-19. And they didn\u2019t give me a specific reason or add a strike to my channel - because they know they are doing it out of bad faith. This video had almost 40,000 views & was starting to go viral this morning. Add this as more ammo to possibly used in the future lawsuit against the tech tyrants we will hopefully be filing this week. THE TRUTH IS A FORCE OF NATURE & NOTHING CAN STOP WHAT IS COMING.",
