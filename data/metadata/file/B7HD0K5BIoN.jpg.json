And while ecologists believe that mitigation processes might help in afforestation, there is no way that the wildlife loss wouldn\u2019t be a major shock to the entire country. This emu farmer has set up a drinking pool for animals. All the dams are quickly drying up, making it difficult for the wildlife to survive.\n\nMost people are supporting the firefighters in their struggle to control the fire. But some are trying to help the animals that have been worst affected by the #Australianbushfires. #SteveIrwin\u2019s family has been responsible for treating almost 90,000 animals that have been wounded over the last few months. Now, an Australian farmer couple has set up a drinking pool on their emu farm, where animals can come and quench their thirst. Henley\u2019s emu farm is located in #NewSouthWales and is operated by Penny and Phil Henley.\n\nThe duo has also installed a ramp that leads directly to the water supply. This ramp was for those animals that have tiny feet or are flightless. The situation is getting critical as around 480 million animals have perished in the Australian bushfires since September, as reported by the #UniversityofSydney.\n\nProf. Chris Dickman mentions that New South Wales has lost around three million hectares in the last ten days itself. But he also states that while most large animals like kangaroos and emus would be able to get away from the fire, animals such as koalas and echidnas will not be able to.\n\nEven animals like the echidna are coming to drink water from the pool. Echidnas are known to drink water only when they are extremely thirsty.",
