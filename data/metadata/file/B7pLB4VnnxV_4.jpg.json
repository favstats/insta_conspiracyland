    "description": "Krystle Cordingley mourns her son Corbyn who died 14 hours after a flu shot. The hospital tried to cover up what happened, and doctors said his death following vaccination was a coincidence. Finally one honest MD admitted that it was the vaccine that caused the severe damage to Corbyn's brain stem and that ultimately took his life. \nThe official medical cause of death was the deeply unsatisfying \"\"Unknown\"\". Assured only that her son did not suffocate, Krystle wanted to know more, and would not let it go. She says that a third-party neuropathologist identified severe damage to Corbyn's brain stem and hippocampus, and told the mother, that \"\"she sees that much damage from younger SIDS [Sudden Infant Death Syndrome] babies all the time, but never in older children and she is surprised he lived as long as he did.\u201d His brain stem had been eaten away.\n\nCordingley believes that it is not unrelated that as well as the flu shot, Corbyn received five different vaccines, including MMR, 43 days before his death. \u201cI\u2019m broken. I am not suicidal or unable to function, but my heart will always be shattered. I will forever feel guilty for being the one that took my son in to be vaccinated, and I don't know if I will ever get over the feeling that I killed him,\"\" says Cordingley, who now dedicates her life to fighting against vaccination.\u201d #realnotrare #believemothers #freedomkeepers",
