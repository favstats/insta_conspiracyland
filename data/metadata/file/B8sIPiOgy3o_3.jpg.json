    "description": "BACK TO THE BASICS\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Everything we consume is made up entirely of chemicals. From James Kennedy, the creator of the famous banana graphic - \u201cThere\u2019s a tendency for advertisers to use the words \u201cpure\u201d and \u201csimple\u201d to describe \u201cnatural\u201d products when they couldn\u2019t be more wrong. With this diagram, I want to demonstrate that \u201cnatural\u201d products are usually more complicated than anything we can create in the lab. For brevity\u2019s sake, I omitted the thousands of minority ingredients found in a banana, including DNA.\u201d .\n.\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Whether a chemical is naturally occurring or man-made tells us nothing about its toxicity. This graphic is from @compoundchem - \u201cThere are many chemical compounds, found naturally in plants, that are poisonous to humans in small amounts; similarly, there are many man-made compounds which are perfectly harmless unless ingested at very high doses. Although the first of the two graphics sorts natural and man-made chemicals into toxic & non-toxic categories, overall I wanted to show that in reality, this is an impossibility \u2013 all chemicals, if taken in a high enough dose, are toxic \u2013 even water, which we consider essential to life.\u201d\nWhich brings us to the next point... .\n.\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 \u201cThe dose makes the poison\u201d applies to all compounds, natural or man-made. A common argument is that we\u2019ve become accustomed to, and built up tolerance to, naturally-occurring toxic compounds, whereas we haven\u2019t had time to do so with more recent synthetic compounds. However, consider that the most toxic chemical compound known to man is the naturally-occurring botulinum, one teaspoon of which could kill a quarter of the world\u2019s population. It\u2019s been around for millennia \u2013 and yet we still haven\u2019t developed resistance to it. Plants, too, are constantly evolving, and producing compounds we\u2019ve never before been exposed to; however, not every new compound produced by a plant is deadly to us just because we\u2019ve never been exposed to it before. Many fruits and vegetables contain compounds that have been shown to be toxic to humans. However, they are present in such comparatively minute quantities, that they are nowhere near the dose required for them to cause harmful effects.",
