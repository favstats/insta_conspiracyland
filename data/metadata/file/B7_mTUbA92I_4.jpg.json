    "description": "What a week! We had the premiere of @onzejongens in Miami which turned out the be a really fun movie that everyone should go see! We filmed this about 9 months ago in Miami with an amazing cast & @johan_nijenhuisenco crew. Brought back amazing memories to see everyone again! @bontvoordieren & I went on another mission to try to stop people from buying fur again. I visited @chris_tap_sculptures_1973 to finish my sculpture. Soon we\u2019ll be selling my sculptures worldwide! My parents and I got the cutest kitten (Johnny) for my sisters birthday. And my moms cat Eddy got an amazing new harness by @vivianvanwaveren & thinks he can fly now! My sister @noodlenadia & our girls went to our first twerkshop which was hilarious! Have a great weekend ya\u2019ll\u2764\ufe0f",
