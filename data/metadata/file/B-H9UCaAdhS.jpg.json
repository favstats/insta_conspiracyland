    "description": "This is @travellingjames_ discussing where he is at after learning about Q. The feelings that arise from this will be difficult to process, and that is incredibly normal. Allow them to pass through you, and cry when you need to. Imagine you\u2019re a sink and the emotions are the water: if you don\u2019t cry, the sink will clog and the emotions will get stuck and overflow. You\u2019ll find as they build up you\u2019ll feel emotionally unstable and the water will back up and go everywhere. So just cry. James\u2019 own words: \u201cLearning about #Andrenochrome makes angry. Learning about #Qanon makes me happy. #TheGreatAwakening will also bring confusement and sadness. I can feel it. Hold those close\ud83d\udc9c\u201d #WWG1WGA",
