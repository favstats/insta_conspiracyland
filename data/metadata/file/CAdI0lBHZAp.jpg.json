    "description": "I\u2019ve heard numerous stories on how they approach you in the industry from signed artist and unsigned artist. One artist told me there was a man in a nice suit waiting outside of her performance at a club one time. She said he kept asking her how bad she wanted fame and success over and over. She had light in her so she could tell something about him seemed dark. She said his look was so creepy that she couldn\u2019t even look him in the eye too long. I\u2019ve heard from another artist that he had a very vivid dream where he was asked by satan to sell his soul and he would be made bigger than rapper \u201cLil Pump\u201d. I believed him because he was pretty popular at the time because he also had over 100K followers. Another guy said he was picked in a limo on 3 different occasions and asked the same exact question over and over how far he was willing to go and how bad he wanted it. I have so many stories to tell it\u2019s crazy! #hollyweirdisevil",
