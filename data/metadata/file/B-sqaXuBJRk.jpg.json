    "description": "Thoughts?\nLocals in #Wuhan, where the #Chinese #coronavirus pandemic originated, have heard screams coming from funeral home furnaces, and some treated in hospitals say they saw workers put living coronavirus patients in body bags, Radio Free Asia (RFA) reported on Monday.\nRFA noted that it could not independently verify that the #ChineseCommunistParty was burning coronavirus patients alive, nor has the #CommunistParty confirmed or denied the rumors. Yet the rumors persist that, to make room for new patients in Wuhan\u2019s overcrowded hospitals, medical staff chose older patients less likely to survive the infection and shipped them to incinerators while they were still alive and conscious.\nRFA quoted a source \u201cclose to the funeral industry\u201d identified only as Ma who said that he had heard reports of \u201cpeople restrained and forced into body bags when they were still moving.\u201d \u201cSome people are saying that \u2026 there are video clips of screams coming from funeral homes, from inside the furnaces \u2026 which tells us that some people were taken to the funeral homes while they were still alive,\u201d Ma added.\nMa also noted the existence of video testimony from an anonymous older woman who had been treated at a Wuhan hospital, presumably for Chinese coronavirus. \u201cOne old lady was saying that they put one guy into \u2026 a body bag when he wasn\u2019t even dead yet, and took him off to the crematorium because there was no way of saving him,\u201d Ma told RFA.\nVideo of an older woman speaking anonymously to a camera began circulating on social media in February in which she said she witnessed a patient next to her at a Wuhan hospital stuffed into a body bag while still alive. \u201cHe\u2019s not dead, his feet and hands are still moving,\u201d the woman says, \u201c[They] wrapped him in a plastic body bag and zipped it up.\u201d According to New Tang Dynasty, a broadcaster affiliated with the persecuted Chinese #FalunGong movement, the woman spoke with a Wuhan accent, suggesting she was a native of the central Chinese city. \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe#Event201 #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda",
