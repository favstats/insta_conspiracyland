It\u2019s terrifying,\u201d replied hlr725. \u201cYes this is crazy and people need to wake up. Just because he has a bunch of money doesn\u2019t mean he gets to rule everyone and decide what we inject into our bodies,\u201d surmised kbebernes. \u201cFurthermore, why is he seeking indemnity from world governments?\u201d said umanie. \u201cAnd why is Marina Abromovic Microsoft\u2019s new spokeswoman?\u201d queried gracywaldon.\n\nLast week Robert F. Kennedy Jr. slammed Bill Gates and his \u201cmessianic conviction that he is ordained to save the world with technology.\u201d \u201cVaccines, for Bill Gates, are a strategic philanthropy that feed his many vaccine-related businesses (including Microsoft\u2019s ambition to control a global vac ID enterprise) and give him dictatorial control over global health policy\u2014the spear tip of corporate neo-imperialism,\u201d Kennedy Jr. wrote. \u201cGates\u2019 obsession with vaccines seems fueled by a messianic conviction that he is ordained to save the world with technology and a god-like willingness to experiment with the lives of lesser humans.\u201d #ID2020 #Event201 #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda #ScientificDictatorship",
