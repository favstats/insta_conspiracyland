    "description": "When Kim Clement prophesied the Trump election in 2014 & then said to remember the name \u201cStone\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but think of Q drop #269. It also made me think of Roger Stone\u2019s current situation & what he has been telling us about General Flynn having damning a list of Deep State pedophiles (Flynn knows where the bodies are). Perhaps Roger Stone\u2019s unfair prosecution will be the public tipping point in finally demanding justice for not only General Flynn, but the Deep State traitors who sold out our country, committed crimes against humanity, & tried to overthrow our President. What do you guys think? @rogerjstonejr \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcaf #WWG1WGA #DarkToLight #TheGreatAwakening #GodWins #PatriotsAreInControl #TrustThePlan #PanicInDC #Qanon #TheStormIsUponUs #NothingCanStopWhatsComing\n\n#TheBaQery\n@wwg1wga_ \n@qmaildrops \n@rabbit_seventeen\n@ashlynn139 \n@_factsoverfeelings\n@ask_the_q\n@teejtheworst\n@educatingliberals \n@redshiftreality \n@qanon_obiwan \n@docs_red_hat \n@brandonthetruthvera\n@patkeller1\n@patriotpoliticsresearch \n@francohammer\n@sergeant_stickittooya\n@cjtruth17",
