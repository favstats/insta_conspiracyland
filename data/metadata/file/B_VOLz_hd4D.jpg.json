    "description": "A watchdog has revealed that US taxpayers have been unwittingly funding animal experiments tied to #Chinese \u2018wet markets\u2019 and the #Wuhan laboratory\n\nThe US funding was used to undertake experiments on animals, some which may have been sold after use to \u201cwet markets\u201d for consumption.\n\nTheir research included coronavirus studies involving bats that some legislators have theorized could have been a catalyst for the outbreak.\n\nThe revealtion has sparked fears that the lab, and not the wet market, could have been the original outbreak source for the virus.\n\n#PresidentTrump has now vowed to put an to end to the Obama admin\u2019s funding.\n\nPJ Media reports: the conservative-leaning animal rights organization White Coat Waste Project alerted The Washington Examiner to the grant, and intelligence sources began to converge on the Wuhan lab earlier this week.\n\nThe Wuhan Institute of Virology, the most advanced laboratory of its kind on the #Chinese mainland, is based a mere twenty miles from the infamous wildlife market which was originally thought to be the location of the transfer of the virus from animals to humans. The sequencing of the #coronavirus genome has traced the virus back to bats found in #Yunnan caves. The Wuhan Institute was experimenting on bats from the area already known to be the source of #COVID19.\n\nNaturally, the revelation that #American taxpayers bankrolled the lab that may be responsible for the virus caused no little consternation. \u201cWhen I learned our government was spending taxpayers\u2019 money at China\u2019s disgusting wet markets to buy and slaughter cats and dogs for cruel experiments, I helped lead the successful effort to stop it last year,\u201d said Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m disgusted now to learn that, for years, the U.S. government has been funding dangerous and cruel animal experiments at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which may have contributed to the global spread of coronavirus, and research at other labs in China that have virtually no oversight from U.S. authorities.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s unnecessary and unacceptable for #American taxpayers to fund these institutions, and it has to end now,\u201d Gaetz said. \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe",
