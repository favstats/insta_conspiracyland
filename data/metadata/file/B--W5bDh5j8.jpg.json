An appeal to Victoria\u2019s Court of Appeal last year was unsuccessful.\n\nDailyMail report:\n\nCardinal Pell was not told of the fresh investigation until Monday, the paper reported. \nA recorded interview between Cardinal Pell and Sky News Australia presenter Andrew Bolt will air on Tuesday night, in which Cardinal Pell said he \u2018wouldn\u2019t be entirely surprised\u2019 if police attempted to prosecute him again. \nBolt asked the cardinal whether he was ashamed of the Catholic church\u2019s handling of #childsexabuse scandals. \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe#PedoGate",
