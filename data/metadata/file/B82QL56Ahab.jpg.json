    "description": "It doesn't take a genius to figure out voter fraud is the ONLY threat that President Trump faces in the 2020 election. This man is overflowing professional sports arenas with THOUSANDS of people who don't get in & end up watching from outside. Meanwhile, the Dems couldn't fill up a bingo hall if they offered free food. Seriously... there are more people at a Trump rally just waiting in line to use the bathrooms! We need to secure our voting system to ensure our elections are finally being conducted in a fair manner. And if we do that, the Dems will never win another race outside of a big city again. Thanks again to all my patrons, you guys are the absolute best!!!! Patreon.com/E4L",
