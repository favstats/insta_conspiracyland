    "description": "Medicines are produced by organized crime syndicates. The official definition of organized crime closely matches the activities of the largest drug companies. They have all been repeatedly convicted of marketing harmful\u2014often fatal\u2014drugs; substantial fraud; price manipulation; and concealment of evidence. The billions of dollars in fines levied against them for these offences pale in comparison to the profits they continue to make, so these convictions are merely the cost of doing business.\n-\nThe drug and medical device companies organize trials in the best populations and comparison groups to demonstrate their point; they control the data, do the analyses in-house, and employ professional writers to write the papers. They then select outcomes that suit their marketing needs and demonstrate the greatest differences, rather than the most important outcomes for patients. Too often, academics are then paid to be listed as authors when they had little input and cannot vouch for the data. Trials with negative results are buried and not published. Physicians who are concerned about marketing hype, and who therefore seek a balanced and valid view of the evidence, are fooled, as all the available data are biased \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd\n-\nTag someone you LOVE!\nTurn on post notifications\n@conscious_beardman\n-\n#AnonNova #consciousbeardman #live #learn #evolve #wakeup #fuckthesystem #bigpharma #corruption #greeed #followthemoney #billgates #id2020 #populationcontrol #fuckyourwindows #billgatesisthevirus #newworldorder #oneworldorder #thegraystate #weareanonymous #lightvsdark",
